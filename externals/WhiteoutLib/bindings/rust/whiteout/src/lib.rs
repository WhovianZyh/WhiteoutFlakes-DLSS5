//! # Layout contract
//!
//! Value types such as [`math::Vector3f`] are `#[repr(C)]` mirrors of their
//! C++ counterparts and cross the FFI boundary with no conversion. Their
//! sizes are pinned by `const` assertions at compile time, and
//! [`math::check_abi`] re-verifies them against the library actually linked:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! whiteout::math::check_abi().expect("native library layout mismatch");
//! ```
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! The underlying C++ library does not throw, and signals absence with
//! `std::optional`. This binding follows that: operations that can simply
//! find nothing return [`Option`], and [`Result`] is reserved for the few
//! calls that produce a real diagnostic.
//!
//! # Zero-copy pixel access
//!
//! [`textures::Texture::data`] and `data_mut` borrow the C++ buffer
//! directly — nothing is copied in either direction. That is safe because
//! the slice borrows the texture, so the compiler rejects any use that
//! could dangle. This must not compile:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use whiteout::textures::{PixelFormat, Texture};
//! let mut tex = Texture::create_2d(PixelFormat::RGBA8, 4, 4, 1).unwrap();
//! let pixels = tex.data_mut();
//! drop(tex);            // owner released while `pixels` is still alive
//! pixels[0] = 1;
//! ```
//!
//! Neither may a shared and a mutable view coexist:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use whiteout::textures::{PixelFormat, Texture};
//! let mut tex = Texture::create_2d(PixelFormat::RGBA8, 4, 4, 1).unwrap();
//! let shared = tex.data();
//! let unique = tex.data_mut();   // second borrow, one of them mutable
//! let _ = (shared[0], unique[0]);
//! ```
//!
//! C# and C++ can only document these hazards; here they are compile
//! errors, which is what makes handing out the raw buffer reasonable.
