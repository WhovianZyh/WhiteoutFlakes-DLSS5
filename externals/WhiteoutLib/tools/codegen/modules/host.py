"""Host extras (threading, disk I/O, HTTP) module config for the codegen.
Native targets only — the WASM web build excludes these sources entirely
and the Node WASM target hand-binds them in its own translation unit.

Covers:
  - `interfaces::HttpResponse`            — value_object
  - `interfaces::HttpHandler`             — opaque abstract base
  - `interfaces::VirtualPathFileSystem`   — opaque abstract base
  - `interfaces::WorkerPool`              — opaque abstract base
  - `utils::OsFileSystem`                 — VirtualPathFileSystem concrete
  - `utils::SimpleThreadPool`             — WorkerPool concrete
  - `utils::SimpleHttpHandler`            — HttpHandler concrete

Subclassing the abstract bases (e.g. plugging a Python `urllib` or a
Java `HttpClient` in as the HTTP backend) is NOT codegen-driven — that
needs trampoline classes / function-pointer vtables that the generator
doesn't synthesise. Bindings users wanting custom HTTP either:

  * Use the concrete `SimpleHttpHandler` (WinHTTP / libcurl), OR
  * Add their own hand-written shim in the relevant binding layer
    (the Python build does this in `bindings/python/host_bindings.cpp`).
