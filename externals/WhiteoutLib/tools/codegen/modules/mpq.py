"""MPQ storage module config for the codegen.

Currently Python-only. Wired into:

  - `bindings/python/mpq_bindings.cpp`     (codegen output)
  - `bindings/python/CMakeLists.txt`       (link to `whiteout_mpq`)
  - `bindings/python/module.cpp`           (`bind_mpq()` submodule registration)
  - `packages/python/whiteout-stubs/mpq.pyi` (PEP 561 stubs)
  - `scripts/build-python.ps1`, `pyproject.toml` (WHITEOUT_ENABLE_MPQ=ON)

The MPQ binding covers:
  - `mpq::Storage`             — main archive class (move-only, factory-built)
  - `mpq::{FileInfo,ArchiveInfo,WriteOptions,CreateOptions}` — POD structs
  - `mpq::{FormatVersion,Compression,FileFlags}`             — enums
  - `utils::MpqFileSystem`     — VirtualPathFileSystem adapter (different
                                 namespace; opted in via explicit @bind)

Deferred / known gaps:
  - `Locale::English` / `Locale::Russian` / ... constants are unbound. The
    codegen doesn't yet group sub-namespace constants into a holder class.
    Callers can pass the raw `u16` value to `WriteOptions(locale=0x0409)`.
  - WASM/Embind backend isn't wired. Embind doesn't auto-convert
    `std::optional` returns, so `Storage::open` would need custom glue.
